# IBC Path Tracer
This software tracks the balance of assets transferred across multiple IBC routes. By prompting for a Neutron address, it derives or accepts custom addresses for other supported chains, fetches balances, and aggregates them to provide a comprehensive overview of your asset balances and their route to get to each chain.

## Features
- Prompts for a Neutron address.
- Derives or accepts custom addresses for other chains.
- Fetches and aggregates balances from different chains.
- Assets to track and chain configurations can be changed on the config.toml file.

## How to Run
```cargo run```
